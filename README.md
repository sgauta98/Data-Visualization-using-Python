# Data-Visualization-using-Python
This project aims to display a simple usage of Python libraries including matplotlib, pandas and seaborn in order to visualize a Microsoft Excel Dataset.

I created a dataset similar to one I use on a daily basis in order to track nutrition and exercise and changed some values in order to showcase relationships on the heatmap. The heatmap will display a one to one correlation between days I worked out and days I had sufficient protein intake. I also plotted the various variables from the excel dataset in order to visualize my nutrition and exercise.
